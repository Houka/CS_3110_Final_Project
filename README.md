## Summary:
Our goal is to replicate the battle system in Fire Emblem for the GameBoy Advance. We will be creating a system where a player will fight against an A.I. controlled opponent in a turn-based strategy game. This will not be an exact copy of the original game but will contain the core mechanics that define Fire Emblem.
